## Hi, I'm Riya! 👋

Currently working with a non-profit as a Data Analyst on an ethical, Python-based resume parser, where I help design and optimize parsing logic with a strong focus on fairness, efficiency, and real-world usability. This role has been a hands-on lesson in cross-functional collaboration and building production systems that drive meaningful, impact-oriented outcomes.
I started out in biochemistry and molecular biology, spending more time with pipettes than code but gradually realized I was just as fascinated by the algorithms behind biological data as by the experiments themselves. That curiosity led me to transition from the bench to computation, swapping lab coats for Python, R, and machine learning.
Since then, I’ve enjoyed blending my wet-lab roots with computational approaches. I’ve built RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq pipelines, conducted GWAS and polygenic risk analyses, and completed an internship in structural bioinformatics, where I modeled protein–ligand interactions using AlphaFold and molecular dynamics to study Alzheimer’s disease mechanisms, something I am still actively working on.
On this GitHub, you’ll find a mix of bioinformatics pipelines, applied ML projects, and data visualizations, ranging from RNA-seq QC workflows and single-cell analyses to GWAS studies and Shiny apps, all reflecting my interest in connecting biology, data, and code.
