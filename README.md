## Hi, I'm Riya! 👋

🧪 I started out in biochemistry and molecular biology, where I spent more time with pipettes than with code. Over time, I realized I was just as curious about the algorithms behind biology as the experiments themselves so I swapped lab coats for Python, R, and machine learning.  
🛣️ Along the way, I’ve learned to enjoy debugging as much as benchwork, and I’m always looking for fun ways to blend my wet-lab roots with computational approaches. I’ve built RNA-seq and scRNA-seq pipelines, run GWAS and polygenic risk models, and completed an internship in structural bioinformatics, where I modeled protein–ligand interactions with AlphaFold and molecular dynamics to study mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease.  
📂 On this GitHub, you’ll find a mix of pipelines, ML projects, and data visualizations, from RNA-seq QC workflows to GWAS analyses, single-cell clustering, and Shiny apps. It’s a little bit of everything I’m exploring as I learn to connect biology and code.
